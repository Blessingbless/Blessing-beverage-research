        <li>What Are Beverages?
            Beverages are basically any liquids you drink. We consume them for hydration, energy, taste, and sometimes even for fun or social reasons. Some are healthy, others are more like treats. They come in all kinds of flavors, temperatures, and purposes.
            
            Main Types of Beverages
            1. Water
            The most essential beverage.
            
            Keeps every cell in your body happy.
            
            It’s calorie-free, cheap (or free), and the healthiest option.
            
            You can flavor it naturally with lemon, cucumber, or mint.
            2. Juices
            Made from fruits or vegetables.
            
            Can be healthy if fresh and without added sugar.
            
            Orange juice = vitamin C boost 
            Beetroot juice = good for blood pressure.
            
            Tip: Drink in moderation. Even natural juices have a lot of natural sugar.
            
            3. Milk & Dairy Drinks
            Good source of calcium and protein.
            
            You’ve got regular milk, flavored milk, milkshakes, lassi, yogurt drinks, etc.
            
            Plant-based alternatives include soy, almond, oat, and coconut milk.
            
            4. Tea & Coffee
            Both contain caffeine, which can wake you up or boost focus.
            
            Tea comes in many forms: black, green, herbal, iced.
            
            Coffee ranges from espresso to lattes and cold brew.
            
            Just be careful with too much sugar or cream.
            
            5. Soft Drinks / Sodas
            Fizzy, sweet, and refreshing — but high in sugar or artificial sweeteners.
            
            Tastes great but should be a once-in-a-while thing, not a daily habit.
            
            Diet versions exist, but even those can affect your health long-term.
            
            6. Energy Drinks
            Designed to give a quick energy boost, loaded with caffeine, sugar, and sometimes vitamins.
            
            Not recommended for kids or people with heart issues.
            
            7. Alcoholic Beverages
            Include beer, wine, whiskey, vodka, etc.
            
            People often drink them socially or during meals and celebrations.
            
            In small amounts, some can relax you, but too much = harmful to health.
            
            Functional or Health Beverages.
            These are drinks designed to do more than just hydrate:
            
            Protein shakes – for fitness and muscle building
            
            Electrolyte drinks – for rehydration (like after exercise or illness)
            
            Kombucha – fermented tea, said to help with gut health
            
            Herbal teas – for sleep, digestion, or relaxation
            
             Final Thoughts.
            Not all beverages are equal — choose wisely.
            
            Water should be your go-to drink most of the time.
            
            Other drinks can be occasional extras, depending on your health, mood, or activity.
